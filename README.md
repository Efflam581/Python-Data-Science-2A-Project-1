# Python-Data-Science-2A-Project
A repository containing our project for the "Python for Data Science" course at the ENSAE.

This project is carried out by @efflam.fouquesduparc and @bastianDupoirieux

This project will focus primarlily on studying rail connections between major European cities, using selected open-source data, and datasets we created from scratch.

The aim of our work is, first of all, to improve our Python skills, particularly with regard to the use of databases and widely used Python packages.

Hopefully, we will be able to start creating nice DataViz environments (and perhaps even start using javaspcript a little, who knows...)

We will also try to document our learning journey, sources we have used and what we worked on, to hopefully use this project as reference. One can dream that it will always stay updated.
